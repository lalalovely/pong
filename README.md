THE RULES:
~Single-Player Pong: The player would try to always hit the ball and gains a point everytime the ball is hit.
                     The game would be over when the player fails to hit the ball making the ball to hit the bounds of the window                            instead.
                     
~Two-Player Pong: The game is a race to three points. Whoever make 3 points first is the winner.
                  Gaining a point is still the same with that of the Single-Player Pong. However, when a player, 
                  say player1 fails to hit the ball that comes from player2, player2 gets a point for that missed 
                  hit and the same goes for player2 as well.
                  

NOTE: THE PLAYER/S COULD ALWAYS RESTART THE GAME. WHEN THE GAME ENDS, A POP-UP WINDOW IS GOING TO APPEAR AND THE PLAYER/S HAS THE OPTION         TO PLAY AGAIN OR NOT.
